# AIRLINE-FARE-PREDICTION
#### This data science project walks through step by step process of how to build a Airline fare prediction model. We will perform Exploratory data analysis separately on th train and test dataset for preventing data leakage.
#### During model building we have covered majority of the data preprocessing concepts and excluded all the unnecessary information and deployed the model using Random Forest. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building 
5. Jupyter notebook as IDE
